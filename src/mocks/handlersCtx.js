era for Newcastle. This time it is the first game under caretaker manager Graeme Jones who will have at least two matches in charge, which might be longer than some future appointments. Jones takes his Newcastle players for a weekend away in Crystal Palace as he looks to give the club’s new owners a reason not to dismiss him immediately. </p> <p>Burnley travel to Southampton in search of their first win of the season. The Clarets need to start stringing a few results together to give themselves hope of not getting relegated alongside Norwich and one other. Captain Ben Mee could return after recovering from Covid. His presence would be a big boost to a side built on their centre-back pairing as they are struggling to make much of an impact down the other end. </p> <p>Leeds sit just above the relegation zone, much to Marcelo Bielsa’s chagrin.

          "Thank you very much for joining me for a relatively chaotic day. A first point of the new era. A big win for Watford. Richard Jolly saw Leeds earn at late draw against Wolves. Or Luke McLaughlin for England v Northern Ireland. Join Scott Murray for Brighton v Man City. Over on mainland Europe, Jude Bellingham had a great day. League One results League Two Ben Fisher was at St Mary’s for Southampton’s draw with Burnley. Two more goals for Maxwel Cornet he has lifted everyone at Burnley thanks to his quality on the pitch and attitude off it. His impact could attract others to the club in January who want to prove themselves in the Premier League. What a day for Watford. An indication that things are looking up for the Hornets and they finally have a platform to build on. King becoming a goalscorer once more is great news for the squad as you need plenty of goals to stay up. Maxwel Cornet is good. The late Rodrigo penalty ensures the points are shared. All square at Selhurst Park after Benteke’s second was ruled out. The Claudio Ranieri era is up and running mainly thanks to Josh King. Gelhardt twists and turns the Wolves defence inside out before Semedo puts an arm across him to give Leeds a penalty. Rodrigo sends Jose Sa the wrong way. A Hornets counter-attack ends with Dennis netting. From conceding five times last week to scoring five this time around. Benteke’s goal is ruled out after VAR spots an infringement. Oh well. The striker gets the ball inside the box, shimmies and slots into the net. Benteke heads Palace into the lead. Crewe have equalised at Wycombe through Tom Lowery, a player Dave Artell said he wouldn’t play because he hasn’t signed a new contract. He is yet to agree a new contract but I guess things change when you’re struggling. Ranieri and Watford are currently making me look a touch sillier than normal after I questioned his appointment earlier. NOW THE HORNETS LEAD! King never scored for Everton but has two today against them, slotting the ball calmly into the corner to turn things around. A fine corner is whipped into the box and Kucka powers a wondrous header beyond Pickford. CIVIL SERVICE STROLLERS ARE 4-2 UP AT COWDENBEATH! A lot going on at The Hawthorns where the kick-off was delayed by a home fan being taken ill in the stands, then there was 10 minutes added on in the first half after Nathan Baker was stretchered off and now a Bristol City fan has needed medical treatment, delaying things further. Benteke misses another good chance. Edouard lets a cross go to Benteke in space but he can only find the side netting with the goal gaping. Efficient. Aaaaaaaaannnnd you’re sacked. “Raphinha’s ankle twisted alright but the way you stated it makes it sound like he twisted it himself,” JR brings us some clarification. “What actually happened was Roman Saiss slid in super late and planted his studs into said ankle. Borderline red card for me, Clive. Really nasty. “(And no, I’m not just bitter because Raphinha is on my fantasy team. He’s on most people’s fantasy teams.)” A fine overhead kick from Wilson to bring Newcastle level. Keane sends the ball into the box, Foster comes to claim but Richarlison dives from nowhere to head home. Bournemouth are 3-0 up against Huddersfield as they further prove their promotion credentials. Kelly adds the third after two Solanke goals. Alastair Campbell is very optimistic. He is a huge fan of the Guardian’s Ben Mee, I know that. A very busy afternoon across the country now. Cornet proving what happens when you invest in quality footballers to improve your squad. I think they should have spent a bit more in the summer window. A fine header from the big Belgian makes up for his earlier missed opportunity. Burnley’s only good player, Maxwel Cornet, has scored again. A long ball into Wood is controlled, he knocks it to Westwood who finds the former Lyon man who pings the ball the beyond McCarthy. Raphinha is off for Leeds after looking like twisting his ankle. Not good news for Leeds or Bielsa. “I don’t remember Manchester City fans wearing towels on their heads when their club was taken over by the Abu Dhabi Sheikhs, although given the amount of water that falls from the sky in Manchester you could have understood it,” says Rick Harris. “It does suggest Newcastle fans have a real inferiority complex though doesn’t it if they have to borrow someone else’s culture. I guess foreigners with obscene amounts of money are OK but ones who can do useful stuff like drive lorries or serve pints aren’t.” As a City fan, I do remember City fans doing similar when the takeover went through. For some reason, Burnley have decided it would be a good idea to play out from the back. Things do not go as planned when Tarkowski is dispossessed and Southampton quickly attack, ending with Chelsea loanee Broja smashing a shot through Pope. This could be another bad day for Burnley. Troy Deeney has scored for Birmingham against Swansea, their first goal in seven games! “The SPL game at Tannadice between Dundee United and Motherwell was delayed by 15 minutes so we’re a bit behind everyone else,” says Simon McMahon. “Ryan Edwards has given the high flying Tangerines the lead as we approach half time. Former United man John Souttar has put Hearts ahead against struggling Dundee, so shaping up nicely to be a good day for all Arabs. A word too for the Scottish Cup, my brother in law, a diehard Cowdenbeath fan, is at Central Park today, so good luck to them, but hard not to like a team that goes by the name of Civil Service Strollers…” We are huge Scottish Cup fans here. Championship scores. “For me Scunthorpe (STILL 1-0 up against Crawley as we speak) have only one association: Ian Botham played for them,” says the wonderfully named Ettiene Terblanche. “Imagine if, seizing upon his invincibility in 1981/1982, the club had decided to play all their games at Headingley?” Bob Willis at left back to help things. Newcastle have performed a U-turn, telling fans they will not be discouraged from wearing Arab-style clothing at matches after all. After some supporters wore robes and headdresses for last weekend’s Premier League defeat by Tottenham following the Saudi Arabia-backed takeover, the Magpies put out a statement asking fans to refrain from such tributes. However, the club have changed their tune, and a further statement just after kick-off between Newcastle and Crystal Palace at Selhurst Park read: “The new owners have been overwhelmed by the welcome of the local community, following the acquisition of the club two weeks ago. “The fans who have celebrated by wearing culturally traditional clothing, including head coverings, have been part of that welcome. Those who wish to support the club by wearing appropriate culturally-inspired clothing should feel free to do so as they see fit. We are inclusive to all. “To reiterate what we said previously, neither the club nor its new owners were offended by attire worn, and appreciate the overt statements of support and acceptance by our great fans. Newcastle United FC and its new owners continue to support the Premier League’s initiatives on diversity and inclusion, including No Room for Racism.” League One. League Two scores. It would help ... Here are your Premier League scores: Crystal Palace 0-0 Newcastle Everton 1-1 Watford Leeds 0-1 Wolves Southampton 1-1 Burnley Gala Fairydean is another great name partaking in the Scottish Cup today. Redmond swings a corner into the box, Livramento gets away from his marker and heads the ball into the ground on its way to the back of the net. Civil Service Strollers are drawing 2-2 at Cowdenbeath in the Scottish Cup. The names are worth us following this fine competition alone. Southampton miss another chance as Livramento pings a shot against the inside of the post and away. Burnley are living dangerously at St Mary’s. Broja gets beyond Tarkowski and pings the ball across to Redmond who somehow misses from a yard out. Thanks for coming, Mick. “Former Everton striker King?” asks Ian Copestake. “Like, Andy King? Had a serious flashback reading that.” Joshua King. Bottom of the Football League Scunthorpe are actually winning a match thanks to George Francomb’s own goal against Crawley. Banks O’Dee, Sauchie Juniors and Dunipace are fine names for football teams in the Scottish Cup today. Wilson and Ward get a booking at Selhurst Park after a bit of pushing. Good to be reminded that something is happening at Palace v Newcastle. Joe Dodoo has opened the scoring for Doncaster against Cheltenham which is good news for League One’s bottom club. Things are under way at The Hawthorns now and it is West Brom who are ahead against Bristol City thanks to a Jordan Hugill strike. Palace are certainly on top against Newcastle and they almost take the lead when Benteke connects with a fine Olise cross but the Belgian heads it against the post from six yards out. “Dilly ding, dilly dong, goal by King, game is on!” emails Peter Oh. Is that a haiku? Mick McCarthy did not do a press conference after Cardiff’s 2-0 loss to Middlesbrough. It looks like he will be on his way later today. Plenty of early goals in the Premier League already. The only game without a goal is Crystal Palace v Newcastle. Up your game lads. A free-kick is swung into the box where former Everton striker King is waiting to whack the ball into the net. The goal is ruled out originally but then VAR has a very long look at it and gives it. Lowton does well down the left before whipping in a cross for Cornet to attack between two defenders and his header finds the back of the net. Bruno Lage is certainly finding his feet in England and Wolves are clicking at the right time. They struggled to score in the early stages of the season but now look very dangerous whenever they attack. Semedo goes the right, he gets the ball to Jimenez in the box who sees his shot blocked by Shackleton but it does not matter as Hwang is there to finish. Rodrigo glances a header from the front post for Leeds, as they look to make early pressure pay, but his effort flashes wide. Wayne Rooney is not in the Derby dugout today. A delay to kick-off at The Hawthorns. Best wishes to the fan involved. “I am afraid,” says Bogdan Kotarlic, “that the top English teams (Chelsea, Man City, Liverpool and the others) are becoming so dominant in both the European cups and in the Premiership that it will one day become boring to watch their matches against weaker opposition, it will be almost always 5-0, 6-0,7-0 scores. What do you think?” I think on this occasion it has to be said that Norwich are just awful and played 25 minutes with 10 men. Maybe Watford are not very good. I was mildly suspicious of the Ranieri appointment and his start has done him no favours, nor do the upcoming games. A bad start for Ranieri as Watford, as Gray does some fine work on the left to beat the full back and get the ball over to Davies who does the rest. “If you ask me,” we didn’t Peter Oh but thanks for getting in touch. “Everton’s starry-and-stripey warm-up shirt design doesn’t compare all that favourably to the US national team kit at the 1994 World Cup.” Poor imitation is the best form of flattery. Peep! Peep! Peep! Here we go. Our man at Selhurst Park. “After talking about the human effects of the abuse Brucie had to take from the Newcastle fans, here’s a potential revenge path: Norwich fire Farke after their latest defeat and hire Brucie on a rescue mission, fresh from pocketing a huge wad of cash from Newcastle’s dreadful new owners,” Peter Crosby writes. “At the turn of the year Norwich go on a winning run that culminates in a 7 (seven) - 0 thrashing of Newcastle on April 22nd 2022, leapfrogging them out of the relegation zone. The psychological effects of the thrashing send Newcastle spiralling to relegation, not to return for another decade. Brucie retires at the end of the season a canary legend.” “That was mega embarrassing for Norwich,” says Rick Harris. “No real effort, just going through the motions. At least Newcastle were playing for Steve Bruce. No hope for Norwich if they stick with Farke – utterly clueless.” Farke might be out the door soon enough. He has taken them to a certain level but does look like he can improve them. “I don’t know what to do,” says Mark Grassick. “I hated Newcastle because of Ashley and the new “regime” is even worse. But Palace fans have just taken my parking spot outside my house. Who do I want to win?” The parking spot thing is a tough, tough blow. Another bad day for Norwich. My mother has just dropped off an advent calendar, so I am feeling in no way festive. One of the great milestones. Congratulations to you both. No Ben Mee for Burnley which is a bit of a blow but Nathan Collins has looked pretty competent since coming into the side. Will Maxwell Cornet have an influence on proceedings? It will be interesting to see. Ngakia starts for Watford at Everton today, which is richly deserved as he was on the only positive to come out of their loss to Liverpool last week. Ranieri will be hoping a few players follow his lead today. Of course they have. The good news for the likes of Burnley, Watford and Newcastle is that Norwich are ruddy terrible. They are currently 6-0 down at Chelsea. Salah is very good. The numbers show it. Southampton: McCarthy, Livramento, Salisu, Bednarek, Perraud, Diallo, Romeu, Walcott, Redmond, Broja, Elyounoussi. Subs: Forster, Walker-Peters, Lyanco, Valery, S Armstrong, Djenepo, Tella, A Armstrong, Tella. Burnley: Pope, Lawton, Tarkowski, Collins, Taylor, Brownhill, Westwood, Cork, McNeil, Wood, Cornet.

Subs: Moulden, Ruddy, Hoever, Neves, Podence, Trincao, Silva, Cundle, Campbell. Wrap your eyes around these. Another week means another new era for Newcastle. This time it is the first game under caretaker manager Graeme Jones who will have at least two matches in charge, which might be longer than some future appointments. Jones takes his Newcastle players for a weekend away in Crystal Palace as he looks to give the club’s new owners a reason not to dismiss him immediately. Burnley travel to Southampton in search of their first win of the season. The Clarets need to start stringing a few results together to give themselves hope of not getting relegated alongside Norwich and one other. Captain Ben Mee could return after recovering from Covid. His presence would be a big boost to a side built on their centre-back pairing as they are struggling to make much of an impact down the other end. Leeds sit just above the relegation zone, much to Marcelo Bielsa’s chagrin. They host Wolves who are starting to find their feet under Bruno Lage, summed up by their comeback victory at Aston Villa last week. If coming back from 2-0 down to win in the final 10 minutes does not boost morale, nothing will. Claudio Ranieri locks horns with Rafa Benitez in this weekend’s battle of former Chelsea managers. Everton are comfortable in eighth, while Watford arrive in 16th and requiring a more inspiring performance than in Ranieri’s first game in charge last weekend when they succumbed pitifully 5-0 to Liverpool at Vicarage Road.",
